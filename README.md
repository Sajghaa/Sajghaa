> God first. Discipline always.

## I. PHILOSOPHY
I don’t build fast for applause.  
I build correctly for longevity.

Execution matters more than vision.  
Standards matter more than speed.

---

## II. THE WORK
**Frontend** — deliberate, minimal, intentional  
**Backend** — structure that doesn’t collapse under growth  
**Mobile** — systems that respect limits  
**Auth** — trust is engineered, not assumed

I optimize for survival, not demos.

---

## III. OPERATING STANDARD
I don’t ship chaos.  
I don’t maintain fragile systems.  
I don’t chase trends I won’t defend in a year.

Silence after deploy means the system is holding.

---

## IV. COLLABORATION
If you’re building something meant to last,  
and you value discipline over hype—

Then we can talk.
