## I. PROFILE
Software Engineer focused on building reliable, maintainable systems with clear ownership.  
I value correctness, clarity, and long-term stability over short-term speed.

I work best in environments that reward focus, high standards, and continuous improvement.

---

## II. EXPERTISE
**Frontend** — clean, accessible interfaces with predictable behavior  
**Backend** — scalable logic, data integrity, and performance awareness  
**Mobile** — efficient systems within constrained environments  
**Auth** — secure access, role separation, and principle-driven control

I design systems to be understandable, testable, and resilient.

---

## III. OPERATING STANDARD
I plan before I commit.  
I test before I deploy.  
I document decisions, not noise.

When a system is live, it is stable —  
silence after deploy means it is holding.

---

## IV. OPPORTUNITY
Interested in roles where engineering discipline, ownership, and thoughtful execution matter.
