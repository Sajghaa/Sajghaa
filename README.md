# I'm Serge — Full Stack Developer & Chief Debugging Officer  

I don’t just write code — I **battle bugs, tame APIs, and negotiate with CSS** like a tech gladiator. <br> 
My apps?  Faster than your WiFi, smoother than your last relationship, and (probably) not crashing… yet.  


## My Superpowers  
- **Frontend Sorcery** → React, Next.js, Tailwind (I make pixels obey my will).  <br>
- **Backend Dark Arts** → Node.js, Express (where the real magic brews in the shadows). <br>  
- **Mobile Wizardry** → React Native (because everything deserves an app).  <br>
- **Auth Acrobatics** → Clerk, Firebase (logins so smooth, they *feel* illegal). <br>  


## Fun Facts (aka *Developer Struggles*)  
- My debugging skills are stronger than my WiFi signal.  <br>
- I talk to AI more than I talk to humans.  <br>
- Stack Overflow is basically my spiritual mentor.<br>  
- “Works on my machine” is my official bug report.  <br>

## About Me  
When I’m not conquering semicolons, wrestling with TypeScript, or bribing my laptop to stop overheating,<br>  
I’m busy **building something crazy, cool, and slightly chaotic.**  <br>

Let’s build the future together…  <br>
…or at least something that compiles without crying.
