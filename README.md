# Serge

In the beginning, there was disorder.  
And I was called to impose structure.

I do not code for praise.  
I do not build for noise.  
I execute with purpose, and I leave systems standing.

Where others rush, I wait.  
Where others guess, I know.  
Where others speak, I deliver.

## The Craft

**Frontend** — React, Next.js, Tailwind  
_I shape what the eye sees and what the mind trusts._

**Backend** — Node.js, Express  
_I establish law beneath the surface._

**Mobile** — React Native  
_I extend dominion across devices._

**Authentication** — Clerk, Firebase  
_I decide who enters and who remains outside._

## The Law

I value precision above beauty.  
Silence above applause.  
Completion above intention.

I do not fight bugs.  
I pass judgment on them.

I do not chase perfection.  
I enforce correctness.

---

## The Way

I study systems until they reveal their nature.  
I learn weakness without mocking it.  
I correct failure without emotion.

Discipline is my covenant.  
Consistency is my ritual.  
Delivery is my proof.

## The Work

What I build endures pressure.  
What I release is measured.  
What I abandon was unworthy.

I leave no console errors.  
I leave no loose ends.  
I leave no excuses.

---

## The Silence

When the system runs, I disappear.  
When it breaks, I return.
