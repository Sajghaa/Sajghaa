# I'm Serge

In the beginning, there was **disorder**. <br> 
And I was called to impose **structure**.<br><br>
I do not code for **praise**.<br>
I do not build for **noise**.<br>
I execute with purpose, and I leavee system **standing**.<br>

where others rush, I wait.<br>
where others guess, I know.<br>
Where others speak, I deliver.<br>


## My Craft  
- **Frontend** - React, Next.js, Tailwind, Shadcn (I shape what the eye sees and what the mind trusts).  <br>
- **Backend** - Node.js, Express, Python, SQL(I establish law beneath the surface). <br>  
- **Mobile** - React Native, Flutter,Kotlin, Java (I extend dominion across devices.).  <br>
- **Authentication** - Clerk, Firebase (I decide who enters and who remains outside.). <br>  


## The Law 
- I value precision above beaty.  <br>
- Silence above applause.  <br>
- Completion above intention.<br>  
- I do not fight bugs.I pass judgment on them.<br>
- I do not chase perfection. I enforce correctness

## The Way  
 I study systems until they reveal their nature.<br>
 I learn weaknes without mocking it.<br>
 I correct failure without emotion.<br>

 Discipline is my covenant.<br>
 Consistency is my ritual.<br>
 Delivery is my proof.

## The Work
 What I build endures pressure.<br>
 What I release is measured.<br>
 What I abandon was unworthy.<br>

 I leave no console errors.<br>
 I leave no loose ends.<br>
 I leave no excuses.<br>

 ---

## The Silence
 When the system runs, I disappear.<br>
 When it breaks, I return.
