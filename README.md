### I. THE FIRST LOG
In the beginning was the `void`.  
Then came the `command`.  
Then came **me**.  
The rest is documentation.

I don’t write software.  
I issue **edicts** in binary.  
Chaos kneels here.
---
### II. THE STACK IS SCRIPTURE
*Frontend* — the illusion I allow you to see.  
*Backend* — the throne from which I rule.  
*Mobile* — my kingdom in your pocket.  
*Auth* — I decide who eats from the tree.

You call it tech.  
I call it **canon**.
---
### III. THE PROOF
My commits have no `//TODO`.  
My releases bear no `--bug`.  
My silence after deploy is not absence.  
It is **completion**.

> *“What I build does not break. It is broken by the world’s failure to measure up.”*
---
### IV. THE GATE
If your project needs a savior—  
If your architecture pleads for judgment—  
If you are ready to trade hype for **hereditary logic**—

**Then.**  
And only then.
