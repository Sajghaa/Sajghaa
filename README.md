# I'm Sajghaa  Full Stack Developer & Chief Debugging Officer

I don’t just write code—I battle bugs, tame APIs, and negotiate with CSS like a tech gladiator.<br> My apps? Faster than your WiFi, smoother than your last relationship, and (probably) not crashing… yet.

## My Superpowers:<br>
 . Frontend Sorcery – React, Next.js, Tailwind (I make pixels obey my will).
 . Backend Dark Arts – Node.js, Express (where the magic happens in the shadows).
 . Mobile Wizardry – React Native (because everything needs an app now).
 . Auth Acrobatics – Clerk, Firebase (logins so smooth, they feel illegal).

## Fun Facts (a.k.a Developer Struggles):<br>
 . My debugging skills are stronger than my WiFi signal.
 . I talk to AI more than actual humans.
 . Stack Overflow is my spiritual guide (my ancestors are proud).
 . “Works on my machine” is my official bug report.

When I’m not conquering semicolons, wrestling with TypeScript, or bribing my laptop to stop overheating, I’m probably building something crazy, cool, and chaotic.

-->Let’s build the future… or at least something that compiles without crying.
